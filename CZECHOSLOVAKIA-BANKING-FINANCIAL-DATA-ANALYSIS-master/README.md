# CZECHOSLOVAKIA-BANKING-FINANCIAL-DATA-ANALYSIS-

Hello everyone! 

I am thrilled to present my most recent endeavor involving a comprehensive financial data analysis project utilizing the Czechoslovakia Bank datasetüìä.

This undertaking constitutes a completely operational automated financial model, empowering users to effortlessly upload data in AWS ‚òÅÔ∏è, subsequently resulting in an automatic update of the dashboard in Power BI. 

The project involves the development of a fully functional automated Financial Model that encompasses four major steps: Excel, AWS, Snowflake, and Power BI. 


In the first step, data is processed in MS Excel, including basic cleaning and conversion of the file type to CSV. 


The second step involves utilizing AWS services. This includes creating a bucket in Amazon S3, assigning roles, and creating policies to ensure secure data handling. 


Moving on to the third step, Snowflake is utilized for advanced data management. This includes creating warehouses, databases, schemas, and tables. The data is further cleaned, integrated with storage, and formatted appropriately. 


Pipelines, notification alerts, stored procedures, and tasks are created to streamline the data processing workflow.


Finally, in the fourth step, Power BI is utilized to build connections with the processed data. The data is transformed, loaded, and utilized to create dynamic dashboards for visualizing financial insights.


Overall, this project demonstrates an end-to-end process of automating financial data analysis, leveraging various tools and platforms to ensure efficient data processing and visualization.
